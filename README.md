## A simple react app that uses the [giphy-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/giphy-api) to fetch gifs:

## You can see it live [here](https://millenevprado.github.io/react-giphy/)

## Created with Le Wagon [boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/react-boilerplate) using the following config:

- React, ReactDOM
- Webpack 4
- Babel with es2015 and react presets
- Bootstrap (css only, loaded from a cdn in `index.html`)
- work with `.js` or `.jsx` files
- main `application.scss` stylesheet is imported in `index.js` as a module to enjoy hot reloading

### Script

To start the local Webpack Dev Server (usually on port `8080`):

```bash
yarn start
```
